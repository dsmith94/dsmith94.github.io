<h2>why c is still on top</h2><h3>C is TIOBE's programming language of 2017, 46 years after
its first release.</h3><p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s amazing to me that we still write stuff in C. C++ came
along in the early eighties and good ol' C isn&rsquo;t going anywhere anytime soon.</p>

<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve done a bunch of web development. Now, the web is way overextended at this
point. Today, it&rsquo;s a technology that does way more than it was ever designed to.
Chances are you&rsquo;re reading this on a <em>phone.</em> If you&rsquo;re not reading this on a phone,
you may be reading it on a &ldquo;mobile device&rdquo; filled with &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; phone
components.</p>

<p>This is a far cry from the web&rsquo;s original design, and even further from the old
TCP/IP suite that keeps the intertubes duct-taped together. Conisder this, though:
C has actually aged more gracefully than Web technologies. C hasn&rsquo;t really changed
much since K&amp;R second edition, aka <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards.html">ISO C89.</a></p>

<p>Sure, sure, there&rsquo;s C99, and C11, both of which are unwhelmingly represented by
compiler writers; most modern C language features are implemented by way of compiler
extensions. Microsoft is the <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/05/03/reader-qa-what-about-vc-and-c99/">worst offender</a> here. They <strong>really</strong> want you to use C++.</p>

<p>In spite of terrible compiler support, an include file system fully rooted in 1978, and
a reputation for being difficult to write well, many developers still choose C. Why?
Amazingly, C was the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE index</a> programming language of 2017. Why, when you can choose C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, OCaml,
NodeJS, Basic, Logo, Whitespace, and dozens I was too lazy to write, would you choose
a language as old as C?</p>

<p>I would guess simplicity. C is simple, and not just to write. A good C compiler can be
quite simple (or as simple as a compiler can be.) C program can be written without a lot
of necessary libraries, but you can be an app written for say, <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/2003">Electron</a>, will be pretty hefty.</p>

<p>A lot of people use the word &ldquo;elegant&rdquo; to describe C. Perhaps we could even say
&ldquo;refined,&rdquo; though not in a stuffy way. C has a long lineage, even before it was called
C. It represents at least 40 years of language design, and for that reason, it is still
the best tool for many jobs.</p>

<p>I wish I could develop for the web in C. Sigh&hellip;</p>
