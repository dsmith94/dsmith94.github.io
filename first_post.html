<h2>The foolish rantings of custom blogging software
</h2><h3>Thrilling content lies beyond these words.
</h3><p>This is a test of my new CMS blog program, blobber. Blobber is
written in 100% C, and is comic-book rocket fast.</p>

<p>I wrote blobber out of frustration with Jekyll. It was driving
me <em>crazy</em>. I thought that in the time it would take me to get
Jekyll working again, I could write something that would be
faster and smaller. I&rsquo;m very happy with the result. I&rsquo;m tired
of fighting 400 Ruby libraries that Jekyll seems to be useless
without.</p>

<p>Still learning markdown, though. I like the idea. It&rsquo;s sort of
like HTML for programmers. I&rsquo;ve never been super crazy about
XML or HTML. It&rsquo;s tough to parse, and readability is very poor.</p>

<p>Markdown isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it&rsquo;s much more readable. Blobber doesn&rsquo;t
support markdown out of the box, but with a quick shell script
it becomes easily digestible for blobber to mess with.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some features of blobber:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easy to learn. Blobber has like 3 features.</li>
<li>More UNIX-y than other blog systems. It expects to be part of a bigger system.</li>
<li>The static database advantages of Jekyll, without the dynamic overhead.</li>
</ul>


<p>The last one is a biggie. Blobber easily sorts posts, keeps them
organized, and keeps all the tags and indices straight.</p>

<p>I like to blog about stuff that I code, so good syntax highlighting
is important. It turns out it&rsquo;s pretty easy.</p>

<p>Code in C looks like this:</p>

<div>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="cm">/* printf() string to stdout */</span>
    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello, World.&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>


<p>Pretty sweet, eh? Why incorporate a parser and write a lexer when
the work has already been done (several times?)</p>

<p>I know that last statement is a bit silly, considering that
I wrote blobber in response to Jekyll. However, I really like blobber
better. It&rsquo;s very simple, so I can write a bunch of shell scripts
to make whatever kind of site I want. Blobber makes it easy to
keep my content separate from my code.</p>

<p>In the future, this blog will feature more posts about programming
and general purpose data design. Sooner or later I&rsquo;ll get around
to posting blobber on github too.</p>
